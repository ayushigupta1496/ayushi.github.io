# The Boot Process
- The start-up of a Linux operating system follows a step-by-step process. This process starts with the power on or by running a command in the terminal.Six steps of the booting process are BIOS and Setup Program, The Power- On-Self-Test (POST), The Operating system Loads, System Configuration, System Utility Loads and Users Authentication.

1. **BIOS**- When the computer is powered on, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) initializes the hardware and tests the main memory. This process is also called POST (Power On Self Test).
- The BIOS software is stored on a read-only memory (ROM) chip on the motherboard. After this, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the operating system (OS).
-BIOS and UEFI  are firmware interfaces that computers use to boot up the operating system (OS). Yet, the two programs differ in how they store metadata on and about the drive:
- BIOS uses the Master Boot Record (MBR)
- UEFI uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT)

- Next, the BIOS or UEFI runs the power-on self-test (POST). The POST does a series of tasks:
1. verify the hardware components and peripherals
2. carry out tests to ensure that the computer is in proper working condition

2. **MBR(Master boot Record)**- For systems using the BIOS method, the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard disk, also known as the MBR. 
    - size: 512 bytes. here, the boot loader examines the partition table and finds a bootable partition. 
    - **fdisk** - to check the system partition
 
 3. **Boot loader(GRUB)**- The boot loader is a small program that loads the operating system. The main job of the boot loader is to perform three actions with the kernel: locate on the disk, insert into memory, and execute with the supplied options.
    The following are some of the available boot loaders for a Linux system:
    - LILO
    - SYSILINUX
    - GRUB2
    
    GRUB2 does in the boot process is :
    1. takes over from BIOS  at boot time
    2. loads itself
    3. inserts the Linux kernel into memory
    3. turns over execution to the kernel

    the GRUB configuration file is located at /boot/grub by default
    {% highlight ruby %}
    ls -l /boot/grub/
    total 2380
    -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 9006 SEP 30 22:14 /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ...
    {% endhighlight %}


4. **KERNEL**- The second stage boot loader resides under /boot. A splash screen is displayed, which allows us to choose which operating system (OS) and/or kernel to boot. After the OS and kernel are selected, the boot loader loads the kernel of the operating system into RAM and passes control to it.
- After going through BIOS or UEFI, POST, and using a boot loader to initiate the kernel, the operating system now controls access to our computer resources.

- Here, the Linux kernel follows a predefined procedure:

1. decompress itself in place
2. perform hardware checks
3. gain access to vital peripheral hardware
4. run the init process
