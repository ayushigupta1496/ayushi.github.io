#               DOCKER

- Docker is a powerful tool used for developing, packaging, and deploying applications efficiently. 
- Docker is a container management service. It is open-source and available for different platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Docker is quickly shipping, testing, and deploying code.
- Docker containers use a shared operating system and only include the necessary dependencies, making them much smaller and faster to start than traditional virtual machines.

# Installing docker on linux
{% highlight ruby %}
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install docker.io -y
 docker --version
 sudo service docker restart

# Docker Containerization
- Docker is the containerization platform that is used to package your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers to make sure that your application works seamlessly in any environment which can be developed or tested or in production. Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 

# Containerization
- Containerization is OS-based virtualization that creates multiple virtual units in the userspace, known as Containers. Containers share the same host kernel but are isolated from each other through private namespaces and resource control mechanisms at the OS level. 

# Components of Docker
 1. Docker Clients and Servers – Docker has a client-server architecture. The Docker Daemon/Server consists of all containers.
 2. Docker Images– Docker images are used to build docker containers 
 3. DockerFile– Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build your Docker image.
 4. Docker Registries– Docker Registry is a storage component for Docker images. 
 5. Docker Containers– Docker Containers are runtime instances of Docker images


 # Objects of docker
   1. docker volume
   2. docker network
   3. docker swarm
     
# Docker commands
 {% highlight ruby %}
 1. docker run -d -p <port_on_host>:<port_on_container> Container_name   //The docker run command is a combination of the docker create and docker start commands. It creates a new container from the image specified and starts that container.

 2. docker exec -dit mycontainer touch /tmp/execWorks  //This creates a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container 
 3. docker exec -dit mycontainer sh                    //This starts a new shell session in the container mycontainer.  
 4. Docker Pull-This command allows you to pull any image which is present in dockerhub 
 5. docker ps - to list the containers on the machine
 6. docker images- to list all the images
 7. docker login -Docker login command will help you to authenticate with the Docker hub by which you can push and pull your images.
 8. docker build -t image_name:tag -The docker build command is used to build the docker images with the help of Dockerfile.
 9. docker stop container_name_or_id - to stop the running container
 10. docker restart container_name_or_id - to restart the container
 11. docker rmi <image ID/ image name> - To delete the image in docker.
