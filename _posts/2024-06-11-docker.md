#               DOCKER

- Docker is a powerful tool used for developing, packaging, and deploying applications efficiently. 
- Docker is a container management service. It is open-source and available for different platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Docker is quickly shipping, testing, and deploying code.
- Docker containers use a shared operating system and only include the necessary dependencies, making them much smaller and faster to start than traditional virtual machines.
