# ANSIBLE

- Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.

- Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task. Here are some common use cases for Ansible:

- Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows

- Manage and maintain system configuration

- Continuously deploy complex software

- Perform zero-downtime rolling updates

**Ansible is Agentless:**

- Ansible is Agentless it operates over SSH, Instead of relying on agents running on managed hosts, Ansible connects to them remotely via SSH or WinRM (for Windows hosts). This architecture eliminates the need for deploying and managing agent software on every target system, simplifying the setup and reducing overhead.

**Enhanced Security:**

-It provide secure channel as there’s no need to manage credentials or keys on the managed hosts, as Ansible authenticates using SSH keys or credentials provided at runtime.

**Ansible-playbooks**

- Playbooks are automation blueprints, in YAML format, that Ansible uses to deploy and configure managed nodes.

**Ansible modules**

- Ansible modules are units of code that can control system resources or execute system commands. Ansible provides a module library that we can execute directly on remote hosts or through playbooks. 


**Ansible workflow**

- Ansible works by connecting to our nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them.
-  Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.
- The controlling node  which controls the entire execution of the playbook.It’s the node from which we are running the installation and The inventory file provides the list of hosts where the Ansible modules needs to be run and the management node does a SSH connection and executes the small modules on the hosts machine and installs the product/software.


**Ansible playbook to install any package and start the service**
  {% highlight ruby %}
   -name: install the package                                        
    hosts: webservers
    tasks:
        - name: installing httpd package
        yum:
            name: httpd
            state: present

        - name: starting httpd service
        service:
            name: httpd
            state: started
            enabled: true      
  {% endhighlight %}


**ansible playbook using ansible variable module**

  {% highlight ruby %}
    - name: print the task
    hosts: webservers
    vars:
        student:
        - amit
        - ayushi

    tasks:
    - name: ansible array using example
        debug:
        msg: "{{student}}"    
 {% endhighlight %}



**ansible playbook for creating user add it to specific group**
  
  {% highlight ruby %}
    - name: creating a group yaml file
    hosts: webservers
    vars_prompt:

      - name: username
        prompt: "enter username:"
        private: false  
      - name: group
        prompt: "enter the group:"
        private: false  

    tasks:

    - name: enter the group  
        group:
        name: "{{group}}"
        state: present
        gid: 1745

    - name: enter the username
        user:
        name: "{{username}}"
        groups: "{{group}}"
        append: yes   
    
 {% endhighlight %}


 **playbook to deploys a simple HTML file to the web server’s root directory**

  {% highlight ruby %}
      - name: Deploy a simple HTML file
        hosts: webservers
        become: yes  
        tasks:

            - name: Deploy the HTML file
            copy:
                content: |
                <html>
                <head><title>Welcome</title></head>
                <body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body>
                </html>
                dest: /var/www/html/index.html
                state: directory
                mode: '0755'
      
  {% endhighlight %}

- Ansible set-up module - This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts.

   {% highlight ruby %}
    #ad-hoc command to run setup module
    ansible webservers -m setup
    ansible webserver -m setup -a filter="*os*"
    ansible webservers -m setup | grep -i "ansible_os_family"
    output:-
    "ansible_os_family": "RedHat"
   {% endhighlight %}


- Ansible debug module - To fetch any information from setup module we have debug module.the debug module has two attributes
1. msg - to print any message and to fetch any value of a variable
2. var - we can declare variable in this attribute.


   {% highlight ruby %}
   - hosts: webservers
     vars:
       x: 5
     tasks:
      - debug:
          msg: "the value is : {{x}}"
   {% endhighlight %}


   {% highlight ruby %}
      //vars attribute has inbuild jinja2 template 
   - hosts: webservers
     tasks:
      - debug:
          var: ansible_memory_mb.real
   {% endhighlight %}

- Ansible conditional module

- When statement - The when statement is used in the case when we want to skip a particular step on a particular host, installing a certain package if the operating system is a particular version.
 

  {% highlight ruby %}
 - hosts: webservers
   become: yes
   tasks:
    - name: Installing the webserver
      yum:
       name: "httpd"
       state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"


   - name: starting the service
     service:
       name: "httpd"
       state: started
       enabled: true


   - name: copying the index file
     copy:
       src: "/root/index.html"
       dest: "/var/www/html/"
  {% endhighlight %}
